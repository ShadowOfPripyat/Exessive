# Exessive
A test/example program whith hability to read excel/CSV files, modify a single table, and save it in CSV format.

Made in **Python 3.12** using **pandas, PyQt5, csv**, sys, os

# Future Plans
- Enable a filter section to sort rows as needed
- Mass Search and replace
- Mass Search and Remove Rows
- Save as *.xlsx (Excel 2007-365 format)
- Add support for loading and editing multiple spreadsheets 
- Custom Dynamic tables
- Read-Only Sheet generated from custom filters.
- Autobackup the opened file (Save a backup of the current file state without overwriting the existing one)


# Currently Failing 
- Saving opened Excel Files
- selecting an empty option of the "Recently Opened" will crash the program
